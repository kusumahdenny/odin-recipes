        <p>This dish was favored from Chow mein, Chinese noodles, and was requested to be brought by Chinese migrants 
            to Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. Fried noodles are also similar to Yakisoba from Japan. However, fried 
            noodles have finished being integrated into Indonesia’s culinary culture. For example, fried noodles add 
            sweet soy sauce as an important ingredient because that’s how indonesian people in general they were sweet 
            (nice and friendly) and had an exotic skin color just like sweet soy sauce  To suit the Indonesian people 
            who are mostly Muslims, fried noodles usually do not use pork or lard. Usually fried noodles use shrimp, 
            chicken or beef.</p>
